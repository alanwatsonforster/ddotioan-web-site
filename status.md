# DDOTI: Status
 
## DDOTI

DDOTI is currently working with three telescopes, C1, C2, and C3.

Telescope C0 was accidentally damaged when we installed the new focuser electronic cards. We have removed this telescope and are sending it to the manufacturer for repairs. We had to remove a telescope C5 in order to balance the mount.

After removing the two telescopes, we changed the relative pointing of C1 with the aim that it would observe the position on the sky previously observed by C5 and give compact 2 &times; 2 field like this:

However, the result was that the overlap between C1 and C3 is currently about half a field. We will install shims to reduce the overlap in June 2022.

Furthermore, the new focuser electronic cards have a weak USB connector which broke on several of the cards. We have only three working cards and so C4 is temporarily out of service. We expect to install new cards, with the connector reinforced with epoxy, in the first week of June 2022.

At the moment, then, the fields are oriented like this:

The detectors are currently not well aligned with the focal planes of the telescope, so there are focus gradients across the fields. We will align the detectors in the first week of June 2022.
