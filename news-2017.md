## DDOTI Presented at "Deciphering the Violent Universe"

14 December 2017

Rosa Becerra-Godínez gave an oral presentation on DDOTI (and [COATLI](http://coatli.astroscu.unam.mx)) at the
"[Deciphering the Violent Universe](http://www.nucleares.unam.mx/dvu/index.html)" conference.

## DDOTI Closed for the Winter Break

14 December 2017

The OAN ceases operations for three weeks over Christmas and New Year.
DDOTI closed today and will reopen in the week of 8 January 2018.

## DDOTI Can Now Close in the Cold

7 December 2017

We believe we have finally fixed a problem that caused the DDOTI
enclosure to fail to close at low temperatures.

The DDOTI enclosure was mistakenly shipped with standard oil in the
gearboxes and small capacitors on the motors. This caused it
to fail to close below +10&nbsp;C. We replaced the oil with a local
low-temperature oil and larger capacitors, but the enclosure would still
fail to close below +5&nbsp;C. This obviously caused significant
restrictions on robotic operations and impeded commissioning.

Over the last few days, we installed special low-temperature oil and
special larger capacitors sent by the manufacturer, and tonight were
able to successfully close at &minus;6&nbsp;C! We hope the problem is now
solved.

## DDOTI Optical Alignment

26 October 2017

We have aligned one of the tubes of DDOTI using a prototype tip-tilt adapter designed by Alex Farah. This is necessary because the telescope beam is fast (<i>f</i>/2.2) and the detector is large (37 mm square). The tube now gives uniform images with 2 pixel FWHM (4 arcsec) over the whole field of view. To demonstrate this, we show below a 60 second image of the [Andromeda Galaxy M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) and its [satellite galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Andromeda%27s_satellite_galaxies) [M32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_32) and [M110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_110).

## DDOTI in *Nature News*

13 October 2017

Davide Castelvecchi has written a [*Nature News* article](https://www.nature.com/news/global-networks-of-small-telescopes-will-chase-companion-signals-of-gravitational-waves-1.22828) on DDOTI and other telescopes dedicated to the search for the optical counterparts of gravitational wave events.

## DDOTI First-Light

30 June 2017

We gave a press conference to announce first-light with DDOTI! DDOTI was operating with only
two tubes, but even so the combined field was about 23 square degrees.

<p class="longcaption">The first-light image with DDOTI showing M87
and other galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. This image was taken with two
tubes, each with a field of 3.4 degrees to a side. The final imager will
have a field that is three times larger. The moon is shown to give an
idea of the scale.</p>

First-light was the result of the work of many people, including:
Fernando Ángeles,
Rosa Becerra, 
Tülin Bedel,
Nathaniel Butler,
Alejandro Farah,
Manuel González, 
Josef Huber,
William Lee,
Liliana Figueroa,
Fernando Quirós,
Carlos Román-Zúñiga,
Carlos Tejada,
and
Alan Watson.

## DDOTI Installation

6 June 2017

Members of the DDOTI team, along with Josef Huber and Tülin Bedel of
[ASTELCO Systems GmbH](http://www.astelco.com/), have begun the installation of the DDOTI tower, enclosure,
mount, and first two tubes.
